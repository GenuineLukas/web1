      <h2>Reasons Athletes Are Loved</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Respect as an Athlete</strong> - My favorite athlete ever is Allen Iverson. It isn't because he was a model citizen (he wasn't) or a good teammate (we're talking about practice!), but he gave you everything he had every time he stepped on the court, throwing his body around and making ridiculous plays.
      Love for an athlete always begins with how they play the game.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Respect as a Man</strong> - Pat Tillman will be appearing on this list, and it isn't because he was an amazing safety.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Personality brought to the Game</strong> - Only fans of baseball's history and some of the older readers probably know Dizzy Dean, which is why he won't appear on this list. But he is one of the game's greatest characters and was a popular player in his day because of it (that, and he was a Hall of Fame pitcher).
      <br><br>
      <strong>Popularity during playing days</strong> - There are some athletes who were so popular during their playing days that they couldn't be ignored for this list, even if they aren't as loved as they once were. And some are popular even if they aren't dominant or more skilled than others in their sport.

      It will be pretty clear who falls under either one of these conditions.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Status as an Icon of the Sport</strong> - There are always those players who weren't necessarily popular as players but have become beloved as icons of the games they played (though it doesn't work for those athletes who are icons but still remembered as salty individualsâ€”I'm looking at you, Ty Cobb and Ted Williams).
      <br><br>
      <strong>Crossover Appeal</strong> - Players who act as ambassadors for the game they play and attract an audience that isn't normally interested in the sport often become beloved figures

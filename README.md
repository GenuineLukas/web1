# web1
You can find the web page by clicking the following URL.
https://genuinelukas.github.io/web1/index.html

This is the basic HTML&CSS based code.
The website is introducing my favorite sports players.
index.html comes first, being a parent page for the other pages.
I used Github Pages to gain the publishable URL.
With the help of DISQUS and TAWK,
I could provide commmenting and chatting services,
enabling more active interaction with the users.
Also, I used Google Analytics in order to analyze the website.

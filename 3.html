<strong>Shohei Ohtani</strong> (大谷 翔平, Ōtani Shōhei, born July 5, 1994)
is a Japanese professional baseball pitcher, designated hitter and outfielder for the
<a href="https://www.mlb.com/angels" target="_blank" title = The picture of Shohei Ohtani>
Los Angeles Angels</a> of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played
for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaido_Nippon-Ham_Fighters" target="_blank">
Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters</a> of Nippon Professional Baseball's (NPB) Pacific League.
</p>
<p style = "margin-top: 20px;">
Ohtani was the first pick of the Fighters in the 2012 draft. He played in NPB for the Fighters from 2013 through 2017
as a pitcher and an outfielder. Ohtani recorded the fastest pitch by a Japanese pitcher and in NPB history at 165 kilometres
per hour (102.5 mph). The Fighters posted Ohtani to MLB after the 2017 season, and he signed with the Angels.
He won the 2018 American League (AL)<a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/ohtani-wins-al-rookie-of-year-award-c300596276" target="_blank">
Rookie of the Year Award</a> and the 2021 AL Most Valuable Player Award.
Ohtani's 2021 season was formally recognized as "historically significant" and a "major impact on the sport"
by MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred, as he became the first two-way player in the history of MLB with 10+
home runs and 20+ stolen bases as a hitter and 100+ strikeouts and 10+ pitching appearances as a pitcher
in the same season while also holding at least a share of the major league lead in home runs in fourteen starts.
He was also the first player in MLB history to be an All-Star as both a pitcher and a hitter, as he was a starter
in the 2021 All-Star Game in both capacities, as the AL's manager-selected starting pitcher (earning the win)
and fan-elected starting designated hitter (as the leadoff hitter).
